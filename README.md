## Overview

### Project Title
**Analyzing Genetic Sampler Configurations and Performance Against TPE and RandomSampler for Optimizing Random Forest Models in Hyperspectral Soil Analysis**

### Course and Academic Context
This repository hosts the project developed as part of the AIF 24-25 course of the Master's Degree in Computer Science curriculume Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pisa. The work is inspired by a piece of code built for my thesis entitled "The Hyperview Challenge: proposal of a Machine Learning model to improve the state of the art in estimating soil parameters from hyperspectral images" based on the [Hyperview Challenge](#https://platform.ai4eo.eu/seeing-beyond-the-visible-permanent). This project aims to perform efficiency and effectiveness analyses of the Optuna genetic sampler, thus connecting with the topic of the course "Genetic Algorithms"

### Goal of the Project
In this project, we aim to systematically compare various Optuna samplersâ€”focusing on the NSGAIISampler (genetic algorithm-based), while also evaluating the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) and Random samplers. The study is centered on optimizing hyperparameters of a Random Forest regressor to predict soil parameters such as P2O5, K, Mg, and pH. To ensure robust analysis, we examine both **efficiency** (CPU time, memory usage) and **effectiveness** (mean squared error improvements) through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation on both augmented and baseline datasets. Additionally, performance metrics are tracked per sampler configuration, providing insights into their practical trade-offs for real-world applications.

# How to Execute Online (Recommended)

To run the project online using **Google Colab**, simply click the link below and execute the initial setup cells.

[**Open in Google Colab**]([https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alessioPardiniJob/AIF24-25/blob/main/notebook/PardiniAIF24-25.ipynb))

### Steps:
1. Open the notebook in Colab.
2. Run the initial setup cells to install dependencies and download required data.
3. Proceed with executing the rest of the notebook.

That's it! ðŸš€

# How to Execute Locally

Below are the recommended steps to execute the project in a **Windows** or **Unix-like** (Linux, macOS) environment. The goal is to set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and run the code/notebook consistently across both operating systems.

---
## 1. Basic Requirements

| Requirement          | Description                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python 3.9+**     | Ensure that Python 3.9+ is installed on your system.                                                   |
| **pip**             | Python's package manager, which is required to install project dependencies.                                   |
| **WSL2 (Windows only)** | If using Windows, install and configure WSL2 with a Linux distribution to enable a Unix-like environment. |

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

Run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate into its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alessioPardiniJob/AIF24-25
cd AIF24-25
```

---

## 3. Configure the Development Environment

A setup script is provided in the `scripts/` directory to simplify the environment configuration.

### 3.1. Unix-like Systems (Linux/macOS/WSL2)

Since Windows users are required to use WSL2 with a Linux distribution, the same setup instructions apply to all Unix-like environments:

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ```

2. Make the `setup.sh` script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   source setup.sh
   ```

3. Upon successful execution, a completion message will be displayed.

> **Note**: To reactivate the virtual environment in the future:
> ```bash
> source env/bin/activate
> ```

Since WSL2 provides a Linux-like environment, running these commands ensures proper dependency installation and development setup, avoiding inconsistencies with native Windows execution.

## 4. How to Run the Notebook

After completing the setup, the virtual environment will be active and all dependencies will be installed. You can now proceed with running the notebook.

### 4.1. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- In your browser, open the corresponding notebook file (`.ipynb`) and execute the cells.

> **Reminder**: Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running any commands. It is recommended to position yourself in the notebook folder before running the following command (e.g., cd ../notebook).
